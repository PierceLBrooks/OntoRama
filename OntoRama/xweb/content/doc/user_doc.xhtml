           OntoRama is an ontology browser application. See figure below depicting OntoRama showing
           Communicatons ontology.

        <h3>Ontology Visualisation</h3>
        <p>
            Ontology is modeled as a graph with nodes and edges. Nodes correspond to ontology types and
            represented by colored circles in OntoRama. Edges(lines) connecting nodes visualise relation links
            connecting ontology types. There could be a number of different relations between nodes, to
            distinguish between them, each edge has an identifier image attached to it. In the image above
            you can see edges represented by blue rectangles with "&lt;" character. These edges correspond to
            relaton 'subtype'. Similary, you can see green rectangle with "p" character, this edge is for 'part'
            relation. Full set of relation available for this ontology is seen in the top part of the application window.
            [....IMG with some explanations - pointers to toolbars and relation links, etc....]
        </p>
        <p>
            The main area of the application window is divided into two parts:
            left hand side contains Hyperbolic View and right side contains Tree View of the same
            ontology. This approach is intending to help user to 'zoom' into the area of ontology
            they are interested in. If one of the views can't provide comprehensive enough visualasation of
            this area, then other view should be able to.
            To allow users to switch between both views easily enough the views interact with each other -
            if user is clicked/focused on a node in one view - the other view will focus on the same node.

        <p>
            Ontologies are not always hierarchical, some ontologies have nodes with multiple inheritance ( an ontology
            node can have more then one parent). From our experience, when such ontologies are displayed in
            the Hyperbolic View, it can be confusing for a user because lines between the nodes could
            be sprawled over other lines. This doesn't give a sense of ontology structure. Additionally, such ontology
            would be impossible to display in the Tree View. To overcome this problem, we introduce 'cloned nodes'.
            Once we come across a node with more then one parent, we clone this node and it's entire substructure,
            thus, ontology will become a hierarchy or a tree.
            User can distinguish cloned nodes from other nodes by
            color - they are red. Once one of cloned nodes is clicked on, user can navigate to it's clone by
            pressing on clone button in the Description Panel.

            [.... Explanation of Description Panel should be beforehand....]

        <h3>Menus</h3>
        <h3>Shortcuts, Mouse Events</h3>
        Mouse Single Click (Button 1) - focus on clicked node.
        Mouse Double Click - fold/unfold current node.
        CTRL + Mouse Single Click (Button 1)  - query focused node
        CTRL + Mouse Single Click (Button 2) - Hyperbolic View only: rotate the view.
