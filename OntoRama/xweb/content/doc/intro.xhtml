			What is OntoRama for?
		</h1>
		<p>
			Ontorama is an Ontology browser. Here, 'ontology' is a set of terms with 
			relationships connecting these terms, forming a  hierarchy of terms.
		</p>
		<p>
			OntoRama is  tool is intended to be a <b>generic ontology browser</b>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We model an ontology as a Graph with a set of nodes
			and edges. Each Node can have certain properties (description, creator for instance) which are configurable. Edges are
			relation links that connect nodes. These links can be of different types (subtype, partOf, etc). These types
			are fully configurable. See 'Configuration' section for more details on config.
		</p>
		<p>
			An ontology term can have more then one supertype, thus resulting in a graph node with multipe parents
			(inbound edges). This could be dificult to display and resulting visualisation could be confusing for a
			user. Thus, we clone nodes that have multiple inheritance. Each cloned node 'knows' about its clones and
			vice versa.

We have used RDF-based ontologies as an input source format. This
approach has the following benefits and disadvatages. Benefits are: RDF
is a widely used standard for knowledge exchange. Here is a quote from
W3C RDF website: "The RDF specifications provide a lightweight ontology
system to support the exchange of knowledge on the Web." Thus, by using
RDF we hope we should be able to process wider selection of ontologies.
Another advantage is technical: access to a good selection of RDF
libraries. We also are planning to adapt DAML compliant RDF in the
future and this transition should be quite smooth since we are already
using RDF format.

Disadvantages are: firstly, some of RDF ontologies that we came across
are not strictly hierarchical. Some ontology items are not reachable by
following subtype relation links from the top (root) item. OntoRama
relies on a fact that all it's items are interconnected and are directly
or indirectly connected to the top ontology item. Secondly, OntoRama at
the moment only displays concept types (represented by Classes in RDF)
and ignores relation types (represented by Properties). Thus, we are
loosing some information from RDF ontologies since we can't display it.

			Some conventions:

			To simplify the drawings, a common convention is to omit the arrows that show the direction of the ordering and to assume that the lower node represents a subtype of the higher node.
