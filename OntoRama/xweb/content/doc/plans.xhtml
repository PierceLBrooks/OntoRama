			OntoRama Plans
		</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Connect to WebKB2.
				<br/>
				OntoRama could act as a front end for WebKB2.
			</li>
			<li>
				Implement Ontology Editing.
				<br/>
				It would be good to have an ability to edit ontologies: could implement different edit command syntax in
				the backend depending on currently displayed ontology. For instance, WebKB ontology has editing
				capability, so we would need to have a way for the client to talk to the ontology and simply pass
				editing requests. On another hand, if current ontology is a static file based ontology - we would need
				to save modifications using the same syntax as a source (RDF, EBNF, etc).

			<li>
				RDF Ontologies, Semantic Web
