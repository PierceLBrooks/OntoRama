           OntoRama is an ontology browser application. See figure below depicting OntoRama showing
           Communicatons ontology.

            In this document we will use folowing terms:
        </p>
       <p>
           <b>Ontology Type</b> is a concept or relation type. Ontology Types are
           visualised by <b>Nodes</b>.
       </p>
        <p>
           <b>Relation Link</b> is a relation between two ontology types.
           Visualisation corresponding to a relation link is an <b>Edge</b>
            (or line between nodes).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Static and Dynamic Ontologies</b>. We will call ontolgies that are loaded from
            static files <b>Static</b> and ontologies that are loaded from a Knowledge Base
            or Ontology Server <b>Dynamic Ontologies</b>.
        </p>
        <h3>Application Window</h3>
        <p>
            Once OntoRama is loaded, you are presented with the program window divided into
            a few areas. You will see Menu Bar and Tool Bar customary for most applications.
            The biggest area of the application window is commited to ontology visualisations.
            Above the visualisation area you will see a Query Panel
            [...TODO: should find a better name, rather then Query Panel....]
            and below the visualisation area is Description Window.
        </p>
        <p>
            Query Panel is used to submit queries to current ontology.
            The Panel consist of a list of available relation links, query field, optional depth
            field, Get button and Cancel button.
            Each relation link has a corresponding image and a checkbox used to filter out unwanted
            relation links. Query Field can be used to type in a term you would like to display. While you
            are browsing an ontology you will notice that Query Field will have a value
            of the current focused node. Depth parameter is used to filter amount of hierarchy levels you would like to display. This
            parameter is only available for dynamic ontologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Description Window is used to display all additional properties of the currently
            focused ontology type.
            These could include: information about Creator of the ontolgy type, synonyms, clones, etc.
        </p>
        <h3>Ontology Visualisation</h3>
        <p>
            Ontology is modeled as a graph with nodes and edges. Nodes correspond to ontology types and
            are represented by colored circles in OntoRama. Edges(lines) connecting nodes visualise relation links
            connecting ontology types. There could be a number of different relations between nodes, to
            distinguish between them, each edge has an identifier image attached to it. In the OntoRama screenshot above
            you can see edges represented by blue rectangles with "&lt;" character. These edges correspond to
            relaton 'subtype'. Similary, you can see green rectangle with "p" character, this edge is for 'part'
            relation. Full set of relation links available for this ontology is seen in the top part of the application window.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main area of the application window is divided into two parts:
            left hand side contains Hyperbolic View and right side contains Tree View of the same
            ontology. This approach is intending to help to 'zoom' into the area of ontology
            you are interested in. If one of the views can't provide comprehensive enough visualasation of
            this area, then other view should be able to.
            To allow  to switch between both views easily enough the views interact with each other -
            if you  click/focus on a node in one view - the other view will focus on the same node.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ontologies are not always hierarchical, some ontologies have nodes with multiple
            inheritance ( an ontology
            type can have more then one parent). Visualisations for these ontologies in the Hyperbolic
            View could confusing because lines between the nodes could
            be sprawled over other lines. This doesn't give a sense of ontology structure.
            Additionally, such ontology
            would be impossible to display in the Tree View. To solve this problem we introduce 'cloned nodes'.
            Once we come across a node with more then one parent, we clone this node and it's
            entire substructure,  thus, ontology will become a hierarchy or a tree.
            You can distinguish cloned nodes from other nodes by
            color - they are red. Once one of cloned nodes is clicked, you can navigate to its clone by
            pressing on clone button in the Description Window. Additionally, HyperView will draw a line
            between cloned nodes so you can get a sense of where in the structure other clones are located.
        </p>
        <img src="img/ontorama-small-clones.png" alt="OntoRama Screen Shot showing cloned nodes"/>
        <h3>Queries</h3>
        <p>
            Normally an ontology is loaded with root node been focused on. You will notice that root
            node also appears in the Query Field as a query term. You can submit a different
            query using following methods:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Type query term into the Query Field and press Enter or click on Get button.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click on a node you are interested in in one of the views and click on
                    Get button.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can do CTRL+Mouse Click in the Tree View on a node you would like to query for.
                </li>
            </ul>
       <p>
            You can adjust the relation links set you would like to retrieve by checking/unchecking
            corresponding checkboxes.
       </p>
       <p>
            If the query is taking too long, this could mean that the result could be very large and
            therefore could take a long time and be difficult to display. At this stage you can
            cancel this query by pressing on Cancel button and resubmit the same query with different
            query depth.
        </p>
        <h3>Unconnected Nodes</h3>
        <p>
            Not all ontologies are strict hierarchies with a root node at the top. Some ontologies
            are somewhat disconnected - such an ontology may include a number of hierarchies, each having a top node.
            These ontologies can be represented by a forest of trees (as opposed to a tree).
            You can browse more then one tree of this forest by using pull-down menu called "Unconnected Nodes"
            located in the toolbar. Once you select one of the items in the menu - corresponding
            tree with this item as a root node will be displayed in OntoRama.
        </p>
        <h3>Menus</h3>
        <p>
            File Menu is a standard menu you would expect, at the moment containing only one item "Exit".
        </p>
        <h4>Examples Menu</h4>
        <p>
            OntoRama includes a set of default example ontologies. These are accessable via
            Examples Menu. Menu consist of following entries:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                WebKB2 Interface. This entry loads a section of ontology from
                WebKB2 Knowledge Base. WebKB2 Ontology contains thousands of types, OntoRama
                acts as a graphic interface for the Ontology. This is Dynamic Ontology and you
                can browse down the structure via selecting nodes and searching for them or
                you can browse up the structure via 'supertype' relation link. If a focused
                node has a parent - corresponding node will be displayed in the Description Window
                as a hyperlink. Clicking on it will retrieve the parent node and it's neigborhood in
                the ontology.
            </li>
            <li>
                Other examples are static files from various sources. Submenu "Web Examples"
                contains example ontologies we found available on the World Wide Web. The rest
                of examples are sections of WebKB ontology saved as RDF files.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>History Menu</h4>
        <p>
            History Menu has similar behaviour to a Web Browser's History feature. You will find
            your past queries in this menu, which you can retrieve again by selecting a corresponding
            menu item.
        </p>
        <p>
            Back and Forward actions are also available. You can find these either in the History Menu
            or in the toolbar.
        </p>
        <h3>Shortcuts, etc</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Mouse Single Click (Button 1) - focus on clicked node.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mouse Double Click - fold/unfold current node.
            </li>
            <li>
                CTRL + Mouse Single Click (Button 1)  - query focused node. Currently this only works in the Tree View.
            </li>
            <li>
                CTRL + Mouse Single Click (Button 2) - Hyperbolic View only: rotate the view (This is currently broken).
            </li>
            <li>
                ALT + Left arrow browse back in the History.
            </li>
            <li>
                ALT + Rigth arrow browse forward in the History.
            </li>
        </ul>
