			Configuration
		</h1>
		<p>
			Relation Links and Concept Type properties in the OntoRama a fully
			configurable via 'config' XML file. This mean that if we need to display
			an ontology with a different set of relation links or with different set
			of properties for each concept types, we only need to alter config file
			without having to modify and recompile the application.
		</p>
		<p>
			OntoRama reads configuration file on the startup and processes it. File
			is XML file and consist of two sections: 'ontology' section and
			'rdfMapping' section.
		</p>
		<p>
			'ontology' section describes all details relevant to loading an
			ontology. This section includes a set of 'relation' elements, each of
			them defining an ontology relation link. Similary, we define concept
			type properties. Concept type properties are properties that are
			applicable to concept type in the current ontology. For example, concept
			types have properties such as type description, creator, synonyms.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each relation is defined as an element 'relation' and gets an id
			assigned to it. This id is going to be a reference to the corresponding
			relation  that OntoRama is going to use. We also define a name for each
			relation link. Some relations could have two names, which means that
			they are reversable. 
		</p>
		<p>
			An example of reversable relation: subtype/supertype relation. Consider
			term 'wn#Cat', this term is connected to term 'wn#TrueCat' via relation
			link 'subtype' (wn#Cat is subtype of 'wn#TrueCat'). Reverse relation
			link to 'subtype' is 'supertype' and following is true: 'wn#TrueCat' is
			connected to 'wn#Cat' via relation link 'supertype'.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here is a sniplet from the configuration file describing
			subtype/supertype relation:
		</p>
			<span class="xmlSnipplet">
			<pre>
&lt;relation id="1"&gt;
		&lt;relationType name="subtype" mappingSymbol="&lt;"/&gt;
		&lt;relationType name="supertype" mappingSymbol="&gt;"/&gt;
		&lt;display color="#33CCFF" symbol="&lt;"/&gt;
&lt;/relation&gt;
			</pre>
			</span>
		<p>
			Each  relation is uniquely identified by relation id number and relation
			name. It should be noted that OntoRama will display only one relation
			link for each relation (due to the fact that they are reversable). At
			present, the first declared link in the 'relation' element will be
			displayed.
		</p>
		<p>
			We also specify display properties for each relation link, such as color
			and symbol. We use these display properties to create an icon that will
			represent relation link the ontology visualisation. It would be also
			possible to simply specify an icon/image location for each relation
			link.
		</p>
		<p>
			Concept type properties are defined using elements 'conceptProperty'. At
			present this element only has an id, which is a string describing this
			property. Once these elements are read by OntoRama, application 'knows'
			that it needs to create corresponding entries  in the description panel.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here is a sniplet describing properties from our configuration file:
			<pre>
&lt;conceptProperty id="Description"/&gt;
&lt;conceptProperty id="Creator"/&gt;
			</pre>
		</p>
		<p>
			While Ontology section of configuration file sets the scene, RdfMapping
			section specifies how application should be able to find items defined
			in the ontology section in the source RDF file. Here is an example of
			'rdfMapping' element:
		</p>
		<pre>
&lt;rdfMapping&gt;
		&lt;relationLinks&gt;
				&lt;map id="1" type="supertype" tag="subClassOf"/&gt;
				&lt;map id="3" type="part" tag="part"/&gt;
				&lt;map id="6" type="inclusive" tag="jointWith"/&gt;
		&lt;/relationLinks&gt;
		&lt;conceptProperties&gt;
				&lt;map id="Description" tag="comment"/&gt;
				&lt;map id="Creator" tag="Creator"/&gt;
				&lt;map id="Synonym" tag="label"/&gt;
		&lt;/conceptProperties&gt;
&lt;/rdfMapping&gt;
		</pre>
		<p>
			It also consists of two subsections, one: 'relationLinks' maps relation
			links defined in the 'ontology' section to RDF tags. Another subsection
			'conceptProperties' maps concept type properties to RDF tags. 
		</p>
		<p>
			For instance, element '<map id="1" type="supertype" tag="subClassOf"/>'
			is mapping relation type 'supertype' to RDF tag 'subClassOf'. This is an
			interesting example because as stated above, OntoRama would display
			relation link 'subtype', this means that the application has to reverse
			'supertype' links to be able to display them. Here is example RDF:
		</p>
		<pre>
&lt;rdfs:Class rdf:about="http://www.webkb.org/kb/theKB_terms.rdf/wn#Cat"&gt;
		&lt;rdfs:label xml:lang="en"&gt;cat&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
		&lt;rdfs:label xml:lang="en"&gt;domestic_cat&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
		&lt;rdfs:label xml:lang="en"&gt;house_cat&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
		&lt;rdfs:label xml:lang="en"&gt;Felis_domesticus&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
		&lt;rdfs:label xml:lang="en"&gt;Felis_catus&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
		&lt;dc:Creator&gt;http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/&lt;/dc:Creator&gt;
		&lt;rdfs:comment&gt;any domesticated member of the genus Felis&lt;/rdfs:comment&gt;
		&lt;rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http://www.webkb.org/kb/theKB_terms.rdf/wn#TrueCat"/&gt;
&lt;/rdfs:Class&gt;
		</pre>
		<p>
			The last statement will be translated by OntoRama as following:
			'wn#TrueCat' is 'supertype'of 'wn#Cat'. However, OntoRama needs to
			reverse this statement as only 'subtype' relation links are displayed
			resulting in: 'wn#Cat' is 'subtype' of 'wn#TrueCat'.
