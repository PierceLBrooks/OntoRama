		<a name="history">History</a>
		<p>
			History feature is usefull if a user browsing multiple ontologies and multiple terms 
			in those ontologies in one sesssion. This feature allows a user to 'jump' to terms he/she
			would like to return to without having to remember which ontology to load. We tried to have
			our 'history' behaviour consistent with behaviour of "History" in most common programs, such as
			Internet Explorer and Netscape.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here are main principles:
			<ul>
				<li>
					If a user clicks on one of the examples in the "Examples" menu - we append this example to the 
					History. If a user submits a new query or a query for an item in the current ontology - 
					we also append this query to the History.
				</li>
				<li>
					However, if user clicks on one of history items, we will display this item and 'tick' it in
					the menu, but history won't be appended with this item.
				</li>
				<li>
					If user clicks on an example that has been displayed before - it get's appended to the history.
				</li>
			</ul>
