OntoRama Issues and Design (29.07.2002)
-----------------------------------------

- design model allowing editing

- peer-to-peer

- subtype/supertype relation should be treated separately in config files and in the code. 
(should this be hardcoded relation? or do I think this because I only deal with RDF formatted 
ontologies at the moment....)

- Graph model revolves around and relies on 'root' node, so does the Query and examples config file. 
This makes sense for dynamic ontologies, but not neccessarily for static ones. Review the model?

- Redunancy in creating OntologyTypes and then GraphNodes and Edges from the OntologyTypes. 
Should review or not?

- Introducing relation types - should have different Class for those or just add some properties
to existing?
(cons the former solution:
- graph nodes don't make a distinction
- at parse time while processing triples - dont' know if need to create concept type or relation type.)
